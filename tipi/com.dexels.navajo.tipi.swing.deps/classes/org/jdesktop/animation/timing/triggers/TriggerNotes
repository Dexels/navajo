Trigger Notes


Want the ability to start/stop animations based on events, something like:

"When X happens, start Anim1"

"When Y happens, stop Anim2"

Also want to start/stop animations based on other animations:

"When Anim3 stops, start Anim4"

Also want ability to auto-stop animations based on opposite events,
and auto-start opposite animations likewise:

"When X happens, start Anim1, stop Anim.
When inverse(X) happens, stop Anim1

Auto-reverse might be handleable through the new setDirection() API
in Animator

One of the problems with the current API is all these subclasses with
essentially similar constructors.  It seems like I should be able to
have the main functionality of creating a Trigger in just the Trigger
class itself, and then have the functionality of the event-specific
actions and listeners embedded in some other structure.

something like:

Trigger myTrigger = new Trigger(myAnimator, ButtonAction.MOUSEOVER,
    TriggerAction.START);
