/**
 * A RemoteReference object can be use in conjuction with the SharedTribalMap to store RemoteReference values.
 * A RemoteReference either holds an object or a reference to an object telling on which tribe member the
 * object is actually located. The current implementation of RemoteReference will by default store a remotely referenced object
 * on the calling tribe member once the getObject() method is used, hence RemoteReference can be viewed as a lazy
 * method of getting objects from the SharedTribalMap. However, if the RemoteReference is instantiated as RemoteReference(Object, true)
 * the Object is not encapsulated remotely. 
 * 
 * NOTE ON GARBAGE COLLECTION: 
 * RemoteReference objects SHOULD be explicitly removed from the SharedTribalMap if they need to be
 * garbage collected.
