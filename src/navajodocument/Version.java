 * 9.0.00 Refactored NANO: split the generic functions and the XML-implementation specific
 *        functions.
 *        
 *        Changed the encoding of binaries. Binary data will be added as text node under a
 *        property, instead of an attribute. So it is NOT backwards compatible. If you upgrade
 *        a server, you will need to upgrade the client too.
 *

 *        This implementation can handle binaries of any size*
 *        
 * 9.0.1 Binary now supports proper compare function.
 *        
 *     * limited only by diskspace
 * 
 * 9.0.2 Fixed problem with not setting mimetype in Binary when using reader.
 * 
 * 9.0.3 Fixed problem with getting not existing array message child by index in SAXP/NANO.
 * 
 * 9.0.4 Fixed problem with async webservice callback.
 * 
 * 9.1.0 Support for orderby construct in array messages. Message implements Comparable now.
 * 
 * 9.1.1 Order by of messages now support java comparator functions
