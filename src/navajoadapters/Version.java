/**
 * VERSION HISTORY
 *
 * 2.1.0 Added generic property support to NavajoMap. You can now use $property('xyz') and field name="property" inside
 * scripts instead of its typed counter parts.
 *
 * 2.1.1 Null release (experimented with open resultsets problem in Oracle when autocommit is false and
 * using SPMap (CallableStatement).
 *
 * 2.2.0 NavajoMap When speciying useCurrentOutdoc the __globals__ and __parms__ messages also get copied.
 *       MailMap, refactored attachment stuff, now always use AttachmentMap
 *
 * 2.2.1 SQLMap with new support for getting 'binary' content of a recordset.
 *
 * 2.2.2 Added FTPMap. NavajoMap now has appendParms to append result to current params block.
 *
 * 2.2.3 Fixed security issue in MailMap for empty text body.
 *
 * 2.2.4 TEMPORARY FIX! In it's current form the CV32 does not work properly with the previous version
 *                      Therefore version 1.19 of MailMap.java was restored (instead of 1.21) and the
 *                      fix of 2.2.3 was applied to version 1.19.
 *                      When CV32 new style is introduced version 1.21 can overwrite version 1.22 of
 *                      the file MailMap.java
