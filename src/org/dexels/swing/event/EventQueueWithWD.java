/**
 * Alternative events dispatching queue. The benefit over the
 * default Event Dispatch queue is that you can add as many
 * watchdog timers as you need and they will trigger arbitrary
 * actions when processing of single event will take longer than
 * one timer period.
 * <p/>
 * Timers can be of two types:
 * <ul>
 * <li><b>Repetitive</b> - action can be triggered multiple times
 * for the same "lengthy" event dispatching.
 * </li>
 * <li><b>Non-repetitive</b> - action can be triggered only once
 * per event dispatching.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p/>
 * The queue records time of the event dispatching start.  This
 * time is used by the timers to check if dispatching takes
 * longer than their periods. If so the timers trigger associated
 * actions.
 * <p/>
 * In order to use this queue application should call
 * <code>install()</code> method. This method will create,
 * initialize and register the alternative queue as appropriate.
 * It also will return the instance of the queue for further
 * interactions. Here's an example of how it can be done:
 * <p/>
 * <pre>
 * <p/>
 *  EventQueueWithWD queue = EventQueueWithWD.install();
 *  Action edtOverloadReport = ...;
 * <p/>
 *  // install single-shot wg to report EDT overload after
 *  // 10-seconds timeout
 *  queue.addWatchdog(10000, edtOverloadReport, false);
 * <p/>
 * </pre>
