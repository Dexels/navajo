/**
 * VERSION HISTORY
 * 
 * 5.1.2 Change in TslCompiler and NanoTslCompiler: when calling getXYZ() method that returns a mappable Array (Mappable []),
 * assign value to variable and in subsequent calls use this variable instead of calling getXYZ() again. This will fix
 * a common problem in calling InitNavajoStatus which can return -1 in case of frequent User count changes. Furthermore, this
 * new implementation makes more sense and does not require a getXYZ() method that is robust for subsequent calls (e.g.
 * getResultSet() in SQLMap).
 * 
 * 5.1.3 The dispatcher will add 'serverTime' attribute to the header, indicating how much time the server needed to process
 * this transaction
 * 
 * 5.1.4 Removed access set size counter. Totaltime of access object now includes parsetime. 
 * 
 * 5.1.5 Minor fix for global messages. Directclient uses system props. Listeners use application.properties.
 *       direct client works now for both types. 
 * 5.1.6 Compiler fixes. The navajo plugin had trouble loading the javacompiler class, because of different
 *       class loaders. Also removed debug data.
 * 5.1.7 Added some classloader functionality. Now the script classes can get reloaded separately from the jarfiles. Should help performance of the plugin remote runner.
 * 
 * 5.2.0 Added Task Scheduler functionality.
 * 
 * 5.2.1 Change in CompiledScript. Now using outDoc directly from Access object ( getOutDoc() ), 
 *       instead of using local field.
 *      
 * 5.2.2 Task Scheduler extended: multiple weekdays, error logging.
 * 
 * 5.3.0 Added Integrity Worker for allowing multiple retries to already succeeded webservice calls.
 * 
 * 5.4.0 Added Locking Manager for setting maximum instance count of webservices.
 * 
 * 5.4.1 Dispatcher is now true singleton. Implemented kill() methods, should be robuust to servlet engine
 *       destroys now.
 *       
 * 5.4.2 Field tags can now address parent maps
 * 
 * 5.4.3 Bug fix in the compiler
 * 
 * 5.4.2 Some performance improvements in ASTTmlNode.
 * 
 * 5.4.3 Document class can be defined in server.xml
 * 
 * 5.4.4 Closing inputstreams when creating new Navajo object (for SAXP).
 * 
 * 5.4.5 Added AdminServlet again. Comparing binaries correctly.
 * 
 * 5.4.5 Support for long in TslCompiler/NanoTslCompiler.
 * 
 * 5.4.6 Some minor changes in Worker.
