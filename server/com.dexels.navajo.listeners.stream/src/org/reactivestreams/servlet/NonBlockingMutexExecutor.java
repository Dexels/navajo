 * If an operation is submitted to this executor while no other operation is

 *
 * If an operation is submitted to this executor while another operation is
 * running, it will be added to a queue of operations to run, and the executor will
 * return. The thread currently running an operation will end up running the
 * operation just submitted.
 *
 * Operations submitted to this executor should run fast, as they can end up running
 * on other threads and interfere with the operation of other threads.
 *
 * This executor can also be used to address infinite recursion problems, as
