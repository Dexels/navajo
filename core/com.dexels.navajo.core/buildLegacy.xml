	<!--
	A comma separated list of Navajo project (e.g. com.dexels.navajo.version,com.dexels.navajo.document,NavajoClient)
	You need to specify all of them, it will not include the dependencies of your dependencies (and so on..)
	Make sure that the dependencies have been built properly (or set 'recursivebuild' to true)	
	If there are no dependencies, supply an empty string.
	
	
	The java compiler will use the following in its classpath:
	1) The jar file in the root of the dependency
	2) All jars in the 'libs' folder
	3) All jars in the 'compilelibs' folder
	Note: The difference between 'libs' and 'compilelibs' is that the libs will also be included in deploys
	(for example WAR-files), and compilelibs will not. 
	Examples of compilelibs: junit.jar, ant.jar, servlet-api.jar etc.
